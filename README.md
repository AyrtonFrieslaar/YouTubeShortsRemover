# YouTubeShortsRemover
This is my first attempt at creating a Chrome extension.
The only reason I made this was to avoid watching YouTube Shorts as I found them disctracting when I'm on YouTube.

At the time I started this small project I am not too familiar with using javascript to this extent although it isn't complicated, I feel like the code should be revised at a point when I feel like it.
I've put comments on most of the javascript I've coded here to help me understand it better. Again at this point it does the job of removing all the elements ascociated with YouTube Shorts and redirects you when trying to view one, but I should 100% revise this project when I feel like it.
